[The Odin Project: Node.js] - Project: Inventory Application
</h1>

## Intro

-   This is the first project where I am trying out how to use Express and Node.js. Using EJS was great since I learned that you can create html from the backend! I had no idea
-   You can find more on the project here: [The Odin Project - Inventory Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/inventory-application)

## Overall & Next Steps

-   In this project I challenged myself to use EJS. The tutorial that I followed before doing this project was using Pug, but I wanted to give EJS a try since The Odin Project uses EJS
-   This was my first time using EJS and it was big switch. I am used to React and with EJS it was a completely different. Starting with the syntax it was a big shift
-   On the next project, I hope to use async/await. I feel that it will be cleaner to start with that as the code that I have for the backend is not as clear
-   Also, I want to challenge myself to use better JS functions such as filter, includes, etc. All of these are functions that are available and can do a lot if use wisely. On the next project I am going to use them
-   Also, want to practice using nullish coalescing!
-   Mostly want to practice writing cleaner JS code by taking advantage of all the features
